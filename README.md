# 🧠 Fake News Detector using NLP & ML

This project is a Machine Learning-based Fake News Detection System built using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It uses TF-IDF and Passive Aggressive Classifier to predict whether the news is real or fake.

## 👩‍💻 Built & Customized by: Lakshmi

### 🔍 Project Overview:
- Uses a dataset of news articles
- Transforms text data using TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Trains using PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- Achieves high accuracy on test data

### 💡 Technologies Used:
